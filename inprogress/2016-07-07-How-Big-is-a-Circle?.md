"Is everyone done? Good! Now draw a circle under the triangle in part 2, and count how many squares it fills up."

I looked at the graph paper in front of me, with a ruler in one hand and a pencil in another. Drawing the square was easy: tracing along the grid lines, 5 grids each, and it fills 25 squares perfectly. The triangle wasn't so bad either as long as I had a ruler. But now I'm supposed to draw a circle like this and count the grids:

Someone told me before that to draw a good circle you need a compass, but the teacher wouldn't let us use them in class because nobody likes those sharp ends, especially in the hands of kids. So if your drawing skills are anything like mine, it would probably come out as something like this:

I looked around at the other kids and their circles don't look much better. With one corner looking like a squished oval and another almost like a square, how are we supposed to count how many grids the circle covers? If we can barely even *draw* a circle, how can *anyone* figure out how big it is?

Not surprisingly, I wasn't the only one scratching my head about how big a circle is. Even the Ancient Greeks, who were masters of drawing perfect shapes, had a great deal of trouble figuring out a circle's area. To see why, let's take a step back and see how we have derived the area of other figures.

First up is the square. If you draw a
