title: What is Mits and Pi?

It was just another evening when I was checking my Facebook messages when this came up from my friend.
"So I was just reading about [Graham's Number](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/11/1000000-grahams-number.html) when suddenly a [wild question](http://waitbutwhy.com/table/how-long-would-you-live-if-you-could-choose-any-number-of-years) appeared! If you could choose to live any number of years, how long would you live for?" [Continue...](http://mitsandpi.com/blog/2016/05/04/what-is-mits-and-pi)

The website he linked to was Wait But Why, a blog with posts covering everything from artificial intelligence to extraterrestrial life to philosophical thought experiments to dealing with procrastination. While the cartoons, stick people drawing, and conversational language the author uses can seem amusingly simplistic, I have never seen anyone explain so many complex concepts so vividly. 

Reading a Wait But Why post is nothing like reading just another science or philosophy book (and let's not even get started on textbooks). It's more like having one of those late-night discussions with a weird and interesting friend. This friend never runs out of fascinating stories to tell. His curiosity always sends him into hours of reflection, digging deeper into the topic and revealing new perspectives that always surprises you. You two start talking about, for example, the recent announcement of Tesla's new car, and he asks [why it's such a big deal](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html). Sure, electric cars are kind of cool, but he wants to know if it's more than just another novelty gadget. With most friends, the conversation would have just left off as that.

But for him, it's just the beginning of a huge rabbit hole as the two of you spend the next few hours digging every bit of information about electric cars to the rock bottom. It turns out that, in order to understand the magnitude of the electric car's potential, you must "zoom out" and look at the entire history of how humans used energy. He shows you the arguments and counter-arguments, the data packaged in stick-people drawings and stories as you attentively listen, following one idea after another and eagerly waiting for more. By the end of the evening, whether or not you agree with everything he talked about, you don't look at electric cars the same way ever again.

Since that first post about Graham's Number over a year ago, I have spent probably hundreds of hours reading (and procrastinating) on that website, and each new post always blows my mind. When I usually see an interesting article, all I think about the topic is "hmm, cool."  When I show an article about some new science discovery to my friends, more often than not they like it too, but rarely does the reaction become anything more than a polite "that was really interesting!" However, When I read a WBW post, something about this blog's style always made me think much harder about the topic than that. I call this the "Wait But Why Effect" (WBW Effect) : the effect of an explanation so engaging that you go "woah, shit got intense" instead of "hmm, interesting."

So what is going on? How does Wait But Why explain complicated concepts in such a simple and engaging way? How do they strip away the complicated technical vocabulary without compromising their content? Why is the usual reaction so much more than a "hmmm, that was pretty interesting"?

What does it take to explain something really well?

Also, what got me wondering is whether it's possible to explain mathematics in the same way. 

Mathematics might be the last thing most of us would associate with "fun." The word "math" triggers memories of regurgitating the times table, cramming formulas before that exam, madly copying down the teachers' notes in class, and computing one number after another for hours. The math puzzles that are supposed to be recreational are also very difficult, and serve more often to frustrate than to inspire. At first glance, math-land might be the last place where anyone wants to find "woah moment" material. Most of us walk through math-land only when we absolutely have to, ie. not very often in daily life. 

But underneath math-land's seemingly desolate landscape, there is a huge *gold mine* of WBW-Effect-inducing ideas. We don't need to be mathematicians to start digging. We also don't need to be able to solve those frustrating puzzles that were supposed to be fun. Just like most of us can engage with science through popular science writings, we can also understand the mind-bending ideas in math without being a mathematician. 

Tim Urban, the writer of Wait But Why, often used the metaphor of a tree to explain how we learn knowledge:

>I’ve heard people compare knowledge of a topic to a tree. If you don’t fully get it, it’s like a tree in your head with no trunk—and without a trunk, when you learn something new about the topic—a new branch or leaf of the tree—there’s nothing for it to hang onto, so it just falls away. By clearing out fog all the way to the bottom, I build a tree trunk in my head, and from then on, all new information can hold on, which makes that topic forever more interesting and productive to learn about. And what I usually find is that so many of the topics I’ve pegged as “boring” in my head are actually just foggy to me—like watching episode 17 of a great show, which would be boring if you didn’t have the tree trunk of the back story and characters in place.
