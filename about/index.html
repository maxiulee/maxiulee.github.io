  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <blockquote><img src="/images/logo.PNG"></blockquote>
  <p> I am a mathematics student from the University of Waterloo. </p>
  <p> This site will feature my personal projects and my blog featuring long-form
  explanations about various mathematics topics.</p>
  <p>The website is named after the book <a href="http://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-education-of-t-c-mits-what-modern-mathematics-means-to-you">
  <em>The Education of T. C. Mits</em></a>, by Lillian R. Lieber. This book inspired me to pursue studies in mathematics.</p>
  <p> A longer description about this site's inspiration can be found <a href="http://mitsandpi.com/blog/2016/05/04/what-is-mits-and-pi">here</a>.</p>
